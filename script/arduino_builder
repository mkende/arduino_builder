=head1 NAME

arduino_builder - Build system for Arduino programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  arduino_builder [options] command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 OPTIONS

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX

The syntax of the configuration file used by this tool is the same as those used
to describe Arduino I<platforms>. You can read about it
L<here|https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.32/platform-specification/#configuration-files-format>.

Informally, the format is a UTF-8 text file, where empty lines and lines
starting with C<#> are ignored (but note that you canâ€™t have end-of-line
comments on non-comment lines). Other lines have an C<key=value> syntax where
keys can contain letters, numbers and C<.>, C<_>, and C<-> characters and values
can contain anything. Values can be expressed with other values by putting their
key in brackets. For examples:

    value.name=text with {other.value}

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILES

When you start `arduino_builder` it will read a set of configuration files. Once
a key is defined by a given file it will not be overriden by other files
defining the same key. So the most specific configuration should be loaded
first.

The following files are read in that order when they exist (any of these files
is allowed to be missing):

=over 4

=item - I<Command line options>. These are not actually configuration files but
options passed with the C<--config> or C<--menu> command line switches will take
precedance over any other configuration files that will be read afterward.

=item - F<arduino_builder.local> file in the project directory.

=item - F<arduino_builder.config> file in the project directory.

=item - F<boards.local.txt> file in the platform package directory.

=item - F<boards.txt> file in the platform package directory.

=item - F<platform.local.txt> file in the platform package directory.

=item - F<platform.txt> file in the platform package directory.

=item - F<programmers.local.txt> file in the platform package directory.

=item - F<programmers.txt.txt> file in the platform package directory.

Other standard properties of the Arduino build system,
L<documented here|https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.32/platform-specification/#global-predefined-properties>,
are also implemented and can be used when defining the config of your project.

=head1 CAVEATS

Not all features of the Arduino GUI are currently implemented. The main missing
features are the following ones:

=over 4

=item Library auto-discovery

For now, you have to specify explicitly all the libraries that are used by your
program as well as where these libraries are installed.

=item Pre-compiled libraries

The Arduino GUI can use pre-compiled libraries for closed source code. This is
not supported yet by this tool.

=item Program size calculation

The Arduino GUI displays the program size compared to your micro-controller
flash size.

=item Program upload to micro-controller

The Arduino GUI can upload (flash) your program on your micro-controller.
