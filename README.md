WARNING: In its current state, MKDoc is known to be extremely insecure. It
should only be deployed behind an authenticating proxy, only giving access to
trusted users.

## Installation

You need to have Perl installed on your computer as well as the cpanm Perl
package manager. On Windows, the simplest is just to install
[Stawberry Perly](https://strawberryperl.com/) which has both. On linux, the
simplest way is to install them from your package manager. For example on
Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, and other distributions using `apt`, you can do:

```shell
sudo apt-get install perl cpanminus
```

On Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS and other distributions using `yum`, you can do:

```shell
sudo yum install perl perl-App-cpanminus
```

Then, on all systems, open a command window or a shell and type:

```shell
cpanm App::ArduinoBuilder
```
